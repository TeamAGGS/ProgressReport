# SMOTE Algorithm

**Why SMOTE the data?**

- To build a training model that is more efficient.
- To be able to help the classifier build larger and less specific decision regions. 
- The model learns about the minority class samples as well as the majority class samples and hence is more generic.
- Decision trees generalize better.
- The synthetic sampling approach tends to be better than over-sampling with replacement.
