# Data Preprocessing

- Selected Datasets from the ['Open Science Repository'](http://openscience.us/repo)
- As part of data cleaning, removed unnecessary columns from the datasets.
- To be able to find correlation between the ‘LOC’(lines of code) and ‘Bug’ column, preprocessed the data to classify number of bugs in class 0 and class1. 
- To improve the efficiency of trained models, used the SMOTE algorithm to synthetize the datasets to have near equal data points for each class.
