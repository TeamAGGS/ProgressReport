# Possible Bad Smells:

- Milestones not met on time
- Most of the commits are close to the submission dates
- All the issue tags/labels have not been used
- Uneven number of commits for group members
- One or more group members to do not have their own branch
- Issues are not closed on time
- Some issues have been open for too long
