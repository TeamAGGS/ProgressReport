# Result Analyzing

- In data mining, area under the curve (AUC) of PD (proportion of bug detected) and LOC (Line of Code) is an important measurement. The larger the AUC, the better the model. 
- According to Arisholm and Briand, if a data miner works, PD must be greater than LOC, which is mimnial curve (y=x).
- As shown from the plot we got, our result (green curve) lied between Manual-Down (black curve) and mimnial.
- So, our model works (better than the mimnial).
